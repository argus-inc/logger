This was made originally for the [cardinal framework](https://github.com/argus-inc/cardinal-system) and [dust-cli](https://github.com/crimson-med/dust-cli)

It helps handle config folder for storing data related to the app. You don't always  wanna have a database running for cli tools.

This will help you create and write content to `~/.fluct` for instance.

## Installation

To install with yarn:

```bash
yarn add https://github.com/argus-inc/logger
```

To install with npm:

```bash
npm install @argus-inc/logger
```

## Usage

To use fluct in your project simply do the following:

```typescript
import {FileHandler} from '@argus-inc/fluct';
const fs = new FileHandler();
```

You can find a example of usage here:
https://github.com/crimson-med/dust-cli/blob/master/src/commands/init.ts

```typescript
if (fs.doesTempDirExist()) {
    log(`Config directory: ${configDirectoryPath} was created ${chalk.green("successfully")}`, LogType.Success);
    if (fs.isTempDirWritable()) {
        log(`Config directory: ${configDirectoryPath} is ${chalk.green("writable")}`, LogType.Success);
        const pathGuide = fs.create_path(["guides"], true);
        if (fs.createDir(pathGuide)) {
            log(`Guide directory: ${pathGuide} was ${chalk.green("created")}`, LogType.Success);

        } else {
            log(`Guide directory: ${configDirectoryPath} was ${chalk.red("not created")}`, LogType.Error);
        }
    } else {
        log(`Config directory: ${configDirectoryPath} is ${chalk.red("not writable")}`, LogType.Error);
    }
} else {
    log(`Config directory: ${configDirectoryPath} was created ${chalk.red("unsuccessfully")}`, LogType.Error);
}
```
